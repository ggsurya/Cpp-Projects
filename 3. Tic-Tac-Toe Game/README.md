# ‚ùå‚≠ï Tic-Tac-Toe Game in C++

A simple two-player command-line Tic-Tac-Toe game implemented in C++. Players take turns marking X and O on a 3x3 grid until one wins or the game ends in a draw.

## Features

- Detects win conditions (rows, columns, diagonals).
- Detects draw when no moves remain.
- Displays the board after every move with clear formatting.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository or download the source code file.
2. Compile the program with a C++ compiler. For example:
   ```bash
   g++ -o tictactoe tictactoe.cpp
3. Run the executable:
   ```bash
   ./tictactoe
4. Follow on-screen instructions to play the game by entering numbers 1-9 to mark your move.
